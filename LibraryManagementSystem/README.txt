*THIS IS A QUICK RUNDOWN OF THE FILE*

To run the program you must call it from an IDE or terminal on LibraryManager with a Java compiler.

There are some implementations that I plan to add in the future. It's a shell of what it will be.

If you are stuck at any point the file data is saved directly to the folders and cntrl+c quits the program instantly from the terminal.
